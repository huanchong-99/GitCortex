# Documentation Layout

This repository uses two top-level documentation folders:

- `docs/developed/`: completed and stable documentation
- `docs/undeveloped/`: pending or in-progress documentation

Current `docs/undeveloped/` structure:

- `docs/undeveloped/current/`: active unfinished work (entry point is `TODO.md`)
- `docs/undeveloped/misc/`: pending checklists and auxiliary docs

Maintenance rules:

1. Add new work-in-progress docs under `docs/undeveloped/`.
2. Move docs to `docs/developed/` after work is complete.
3. Keep `docs/undeveloped/current/TODO.md` as the single source of truth for active unfinished tasks.
